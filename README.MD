# MC Bot
This project allows you to run a swarm of bots from through REST API! This is can easily be coupled with a decision engine, task scheduler or run manually. 

## Running
* ```npm install -g ts-node```
* Start minecraft and run ```/publish 1337```
* Now start the API ```tsc app.ts```
* Use the postman collection to initialise a bot, now you can run commands like fight an entity or collect resources.
